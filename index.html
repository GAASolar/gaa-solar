    <h2>The Key Benefits of Switching to Solar</h2>
    <p>Discover how switching to solar enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and drives business growth with smarter, faster processes.</p>
    <div class="benefits-grid">
      <div class="benefit-card">
        <h3>Energy Independence</h3>
        <p>Solar panels allow you to become less reliant on utility companies and price fluctuations. With battery storage, you can even keep your lights on during outages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="benefit-card">
        <h3>Environmentally Friendly</h3>
        <p>Solar energy is clean and renewable. It significantly reduces your carbon footprint, helping to combat climate change and decrease air pollution caused by fossil fuels.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="benefit-card">
        <h3>Low Maintenance Costs</h3>
        <p>Solar systems have few moving parts, so they require minimal maintenance. Most panels come with warranties of 20–25 years, ensuring long-term performance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="benefit-card">
        <h3>Lower Electricity Bills</h3>
        <p>By generating your own power, you reduce or even eliminate your monthly electricity costs. In many areas, you can also earn credits or payments for excess energy you send back to the grid (net metering).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="benefit-card">
        <h3>Incentives and Rebates</h3>
        <p>Many governments offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to help cover the cost of solar installation. These can significantly reduce your upfront investment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="benefit-card">
        <h3>Increased Property Value</h3>
        <p>Homes with solar panels are often more attractive to buyers and can sell at a premium. Studies show that solar-equipped homes sell faster and for more money.</p>

        <p>Finding a trust worthy solar company is the biggest challenge we face in current days. George and his team were respectful, honest, and upfront with everything. This was the only solar company that took the time to understand my power usages and find me the best solar system for our needs. I will highly recommend his company to anyone looking to install solar.</p>

        <p>George and his team visited our home to install a 6.6kw Solar system and we are very happy with our decision to go with GAA Electrical. They went above and beyond to make sure our installation was to our liking and everything turned out great! I have already recommended to friends and family.</p>

        <p>After dealing with four different electricians who either couldn’t figure out the issue, did a half job, or left a mess behind, I was honestly giving up. That’s when I found George and his team, and I only wish I had called GAA first! George showed up on time, quickly diagnosed the issue, and handled it with complete professionalism. It was such a relief to finally have a team that knew what they were doing and took pride in their work. Highly recommend George and his team if you want the job done right!</p>
